/**
 * Provides the application layer implementation for simulating a web
 * application powered by the <b>Grid Integrated Decentral Protocol
 * (GIDP)
 * </b>.
 *
 * <p>
 * This package leverages the underlying network tools (defined in the
 * {@code network} package) to mimic the behavior of a fully decentralized,
 * peer-to-peer web application.
 * It acts as the bridge between the simulated network infrastructure and the
 * intended protocol logic.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Core Objectives:</h3>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <b>Protocol Design:</b> To develop and prototype a custom
 * decentralized web protocol (GIDP).
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <b>Simulation & Analysis:</b> To predict protocol behavior,
 * traffic patterns, and node interactions within a controlled
 * simulation environment before deployment.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <b>Real-world Adaptation:</b> To build a scalable architecture that can be
 * transitioned from a simulation tool into a real-world,
 * production-ready standard.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <b>Future Vision:</b> To pave the way for next-generation decentralized
 * websites and contribute to the evolution of Web3 infrastructure.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
